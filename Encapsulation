3 pillars of oops
=================
1. Encapsulation => It speaks about security
2. Inheritance => It speaks about reusability
3. Polymorphism => It speaks about flexibility

Datahiding
==========
Our internal data should not go to the outside world directly that is outside person should
not
access our interal data directly.
By using private modifiers we can implement "datahiding".
eg:: class Account{
private double balance;
}
Advantage of Datahiding is security.
Recommended modifier for data members is private.

Encapsulation
=============
● Binding of data and corresponding methods into a single unit is called
"Encapsulation".
● It also refers to providing controlled access to the most important component (data)
of a class using the private keyword, setter and getter method.

Syntax for setter method
a. compulsory the method name should start with set.
b. it should be public.
c. return type should be void.
d. compulsorily it should have some argument.
Syntax for getter method
a. compulsory the method name should start with get.
b. it should be public.
c. return type should not be void.
d. compulsorily it should not have any argument.
JavaBean
========
It is a simple java class with private properties and public getter and setter methods.
