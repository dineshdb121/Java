At a time on StringBuffer object only one thread can operate
Since only one thread operate it is "ThreadSafety".
Performance is low.

StringBuilder => 1.5 V
All the methods present are not synchronized
At a time on StringBuilder object many threads can operate
So it is not "ThreadSafety".
Performance is high.
